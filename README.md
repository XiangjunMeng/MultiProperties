# MultiProperties
Netbeans implementation of the very useful eclipse plugin "Multiproperties" by Kriszti√°n Zsolt Sallai.

The original eclipse plugin can be found here [Multiproperties eclipse plugin](https://github.com/skazsi/multiproperties)

The files written by the eclipse plugin (*.multiproperties) can be edited under
netbeans using this plugin.

## Release
Beta release

The implementation is not yet finished, so you should not use this plugin in a
production environment at the moment...

This plugin is written from scratch, no code sharing with the original plugin.

Not every feature of the original plugin is implemented.

The plugin is available in the netbeans plugin portal [MultiProperties netbeans plugin](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/63739/?show=true)


## Compatibility with Eclipse plugin
The netbeans generated files (*.multiproperties) is compatible with the one
generated by the Eclipe plugin, but there are some limitation:

- Only the "Java Properties Handler" is supported
- The relative path are not supported by the eclipse plugin (if you save the
  java handler with a relative path to the .multiproperties file with netbeans,
  Eclipse cannot handle it)

## Standalone application

A stand alone version is also available which permits for non developer to start
an application and save the multiproperties files.

The standalone version implements the concept of "Session", which is a group of opened
files, so it's easy to switch from a group of file to another group of files.

A Java Web Start for the standalone version can be found at
[www.knop-tech.com](http://tools.knop-tech.com)

## Utils

A ResourceBundle implementation is available to directly use the multiproperties
file for localization.

Example

    ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("lsimedia/multiproperties/utils/ml", new Locale("fr"), MultiPropertiesResourceBundleControl.Control);  
    String key = bundle.getString("word_yes");
